TODO:

- now that I figured out the DB connection issues
- try dockerizing the app again and see if it can connect with DB
- fill out readme
- add screenshots to readme on github
- add swagger annotations and make sure /api link looks good
- clean up all files
- in the controller have @Post() and then @CreateCustomerDocs() for example to clean up that file
  - add customer.controller.docs.ts
- see about adding some hard coded JWT Authentication logic, look at a tutorial
- fill out candy-store.yaml, pull up IssuesApi yaml on the other screen and work off of it
